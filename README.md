# Intelligent System Project

This project is built using **Streamlit**, **Machine Learning**, and **Neural Networks** to:  
1. **Predict Titanic passenger survival** using ML models.  
2. **Classify animal images** using a ResNet-based Neural Network.  

---

# Model

The models were trained in Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) using Visual Studio Code :  
1. Trained using Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
2. Implemented with a ResNet18-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into different animal categories.
